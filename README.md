# Marval-App
in this project i used several technologies to achieve best performance , i used :

- kotlin 
- Android Architecture component
- Mvvm 
- RX 
- Koin for dependency injection
- Retrofite for calling apis
- Using RXjava tools (PublishRelay with debounce)to manage duplicate or unneeded requests in autocomplete search
- Using ParallaxRecyclerView third library Api to Implement a parallax effect to the charactersâ€™ cells when scrolling
 

and considered clean code , easy-to-read code , user-friendly UI and bug-free code.
